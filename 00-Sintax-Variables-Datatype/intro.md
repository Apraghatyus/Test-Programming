The langueage that we gonna work is Python to backend, TypeScript to frontend.
So we gonna use to Docker to build the containers to run the code and so many ideas that I know now but I don't use without AI.

I want to be a excelent Programmer, and I need to try understand the code without use the best to that is AI.

The Idea is build understand line by line how to create programms to the future when I use the AI I can understand any functions that It wrote.

We gonna research about frameworks to how to run a server, frameworks to make any styles in frontend.

The idea is start with the escencial to write code and don't use AI to do the stuff, read doc.

 Exercise:
 * - Created a comment with code and send the URL of the any webpage with Python and TS
 * - Represent the different of type of syntax that you need to run the code
 * - Create a the different type of variables that you can use to represent any primitive data of the language.
 * - Print "Hello [Language Programming's name]"
